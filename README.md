# ![Header Banner: Hi! Iâ€™m Rozallin]( https://imgur.com/5fNef49.png)
Iâ€™m a student of the [BSc(Hons) Cyber Security](http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60) degree offered by the [Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk). I have some proficiency in Perl, Python and Java, but I really enjoy web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node.js, React) and PHP.
