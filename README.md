# ![Header Banner: Hi! Iâ€™m Rozallin]( https://imgur.com/5fNef49.png)
Iâ€™m a student in my fourth year (of six) of the BSc(Hons) Computing and IT (Software Development specialisation) degree offered by the Open University. I have some proficiency in Python and Java, but Iâ€™m really passionate about web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
